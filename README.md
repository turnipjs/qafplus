# Quark and Friends Plus

A modpack containing Quark, Quark Oddities, Friends of quark, Quests with FTB Quests, and other quality of life mods like AppleSkin, JEI, JourneyMap, Wawla, etc.

**This modpack is still in alpha, it may contain glitches, imbalances, etc. and not all of the features are fully implemented. The current releases are meant for user testing and feedback.**

The mods have been selected to keep the spirit of vanilla Minecraft while adding interesting and unique features and improving on some vanilla ones. This pack adds features like new biomes, redstone tools, mobs, and building blocks and improves vanilla features like mine shafts, caves, and armor stands. The pack also adds quality of life mods that make the Minecraft interface faster, more usable, and informative.

The pack will also include quests in the future although they are not yet implemented. (That's what I'm working on presently)
